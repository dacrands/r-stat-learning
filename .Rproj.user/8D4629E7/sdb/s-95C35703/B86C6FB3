It would be nice to have these be our row names, as opposed to data. For this we can use the `rownames` function, which sets the row names on our `college` dframe using the values from the first column, which has the names of our schools.\n\n```{r}\nrownames(college) = college[,1]\nsummary(college)\n```\n\nIf you call `fix(college)` you will see a new col labelled `row.names` but we still have that pesky `X` col, so let's get rid of that.\n\n```{r}\ncollege = college[,-1]\nsummary(college)\n```\n\n## Create a new col of *Elite* Schools\n\nFirst, create a vector of length equal to the number of rows in our college dframe For this, we can use `rep`, which takes a value to replicate and the number of times to replicate this value. `nrow` can be used here to return the number of rows in our matrix.\n\n```{r}\nElite = rep(\"No\", nrow(college))\n```\n\nNow we need to assign \"Yes\" to the Elite schools. Elite schools are defined as schools where over 50% of new students are from the Top 10% of their HS class. We also need to tell R that this is categorical data, which we can do using `as.factor(Elite)`. Then finally, we will create new `college` dframe with our `Elite` vector added.\n\n```{r}\nElite[college$Top10perc > 50] = \"Yes\"\nElite = as.factor(Elite)\ncollege = data.frame(college, Elite)\nsummary(college)\n```\n\nVery Cool, now let's so some visualization\n\n## Data Visualization\n\n### Plot\nLet's see how many PhD's work at the elite schools relative to non-elite schools. For this we can use `plot()`\n\n```{r}\nplot(college$Elite, college$PhD, xlab=\"Elite\", ylab=\"% Faculty with a PhD\")\n```\n\nWell, I suppose that's not much of a surprise -- faculty at elite schools are more like to have a PhD.\n\nI wonder if books are more expensive at the elite schools and what the student/faculty ratios are like. Let's put these plots on the same figure too, using `par()`\n\n```{r}\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\n\nplot(college$Elite, college$Books, xlab=\"Elite\", ylab=\"Est. Books Cost\")\n\nplot(college$Elite, college$S.F.Ratio, xlab=\"Elite\", ylab=\"student/faculty ratio\")\n```\n\nEh, marginal differences. There has to be something a bit juicier.\n\n```{r}\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\n\nplot(college$Elite, college$perc.alumni, xlab=\"Elite\", ylab=\"% alums who give $\")\n\nplot(college$Elite, college$Expend, xlab=\"Elite\", ylab=\"$ spent on students\")\n```\n\n\n\n```{r}\nplot(college$Elite, college$Grad.Rate, xlab=\"Elite\", ylab=\"$ spent on students\")\n```\n\n",
